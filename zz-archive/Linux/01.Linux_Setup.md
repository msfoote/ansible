# Linux Setup

## Something

### Static IP Address

Setup a static ip address after completing installation. Instructions taken from [this blog post](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-configure-static-ip-address-on-ubuntu-18-04/). The instructions are Ubuntu Server specific.

Log into the terminal of the specified machine
Find the network interface you want a static ip set

```bash
ip link
```

Edit the `Netplan` configuration file `/etc/netplan/*.yaml`

```bash
sudo nano /etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml
```

Revise the following text replacing any field designated as field_name

```yml
network:
    ethernets:
    network_device_name:
        addresses:
        - desired_ip_address/24
        nameservers:
        addresses:
        - 8.8.8.8
        - 8.8.4.4
        search: []
        routes:
        - to: default
        via: 192.168.1.1
    version: 2
```

Apply the changes

```bash
sudo netplan apply
```

You may be booted from the server while the changes occur.

### Resize LVM - Taken from [https://technotim.live/posts/fist-13-things-linux/#fix-lvm](https://technotim.live/posts/fist-13-things-linux/#fix-lvm)

```Bash
sudo lvm
lvscan
```

Your logical volumes will be displayed

Now we need to resize the logical volume group, usually the first one in the list but check to be sure!

```Bash
lvextend -l +100%FREE /dev/vgubuntu-server/root
exit
```

FInally we need to resize the file system

```Bash
sudo resize2fs /dev/vgubuntu-server/root
```

### Copy SSH Keys

From a computer with proper keys setup use the following command.

```Bash
ssh-copy-id msfoote@<Hostname>
```

### Update packages

```Bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```
